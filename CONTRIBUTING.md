## Contributing

Below are guidelines for contributing code wise. 

* [Centmin Mod Insights forum](https://community.centminmod.com/forums/centmin-mod-insights.20/) is the place to ask questions or clarifications about how Centmin Mod works under the hood.
* Every Git committed code also has a corresponding forum thread in [Centmin Mod Github.com Repo forums](https://community.centminmod.com/link-forums/centmin-mod-github-com-repository.13/) if you're more comfortable using the forums instead of the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/centminmod/centminmod/issues).

# Bug Reports

* Bug reports can be made via [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/centminmod/centminmod/issues) or Centmin Mod official forum's [Bug Reports forums](https://community.centminmod.com/forums/bug-reports.12/).

# Pull Requests

* Pull requests can be done against the current [Github active branches](https://github.com/centminmod/centminmod/branches/active) - currently being [123.08stable](https://github.com/centminmod/centminmod/tree/123.08stable) and [123.09beta01](https://github.com/centminmod/centminmod/tree/123.09beta01). Usually once weekly, active branch changes are then merged into [master branch](https://github.com/centminmod/centminmod).
