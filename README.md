## Centmin Mod Unattended Command Line Install

Fastest method of install and allows fully unattended installation. Just type this command as root user in SSH on a fresh CentOS 7 server. Installation should take between 15-30 minutes on a fast server or up to 50-70 minutes on a slower server depending on server specs and your server's network connectivity and download speed.

Centmin Mod versions are undergoing a transition version branch wise:

1. Previous 124.00stable is now moving to 131.00stable and now 132.00stable. 131.00stable is essentially based on the well tested 130.00beta01 branch. All development and changes made in 130.00beta01 are now in 131.00stable. The 132.00stable, only changed default MariaDB 10.4 MySQL server to MariaDB 10.6 MySQL server.
2. A new 140.00beta01 branch has started and this is also based off of 130.00ebat01 branch but with additional development and code to support EL8+ operating systems like CentOS 8/9, Alma Linux 8/9 and Rocky Linux 8/9. Now 141.00beta01 is based off of 140.00beta01 and starts development work to support EL10, for CentOS Stream 10, AlmaLinux 10, Rocky Linux 10.
