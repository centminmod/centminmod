## Centmin Mod Unattended Command Line Install

Fastest method of install and allows fully unattended installation. Just type this command as root user in SSH on a fresh CentOS 7 server. Installation should take between 15-30 minutes on a fast server or up to 50-70 minutes on a slower server depending on server specs and your server's network connectivity and download speed.

As at July 1, 2024, Centmin Mod versions are undergoing a transition version branch wise. February 15, 2025 update with 132.00stable which changes from MariaDB 10.4 default to MariaDB 10.6 LTS default:

1. Previous 124.00stable is now moving to 132.00stable. 132.00stable is essentially based on the well tested 130.00beta01 branch. All development and changes made in 130.00beta01 are now in 132.00stable.
2. A new 140.00beta01 branch has started and this is also based off of 130.00ebat01 branch but with additional development and code to eventually support EL8+ operating systems like CentOS 8, Alma Linux 8 and Rocky Linux 8. This branch will take over from 130.00beta01 as the development beta branch. EL8+ operating system support is now officially supported.
